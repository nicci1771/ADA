# ADA: A Game-Theoretic Perspective on Data Augmentation for Object Detection

This is an implementation of [ADA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.07735.pdf) using Python, Pytorch and Matlab.

The repository includes:
* Library of edge_boxes and faster_rcnn for bounding box proposal and feature extracting.
* Python code of the ADA algorithm.
* Part results of experiment on VOC 2007 dataset.
